Surreal Docs is the first all-encompassing docs generation system for Unreal Engine-powered projects. It generates documentation for Unreal Engine projects, C++ and Blueprint API references in particular. It enables users to create their own custom pages using a feature-rich dialect of Markdown. Surreal Docs seamlessly integrates with our online docs hosting - Surreal Cloud, making it easy to share the docs publicly, privately with a team or within an organization. Finally, Surreal Docs perfectly understands all UE-specific C++ features, Blueprints and easily interweaves corresponding C++ and Blueprint entities in the resulting documentation!

## Install

To install Surreal Docs please download the latest installer from the Releases
page and run it. Note, that in order to work correctly Surreal Docs 
requires NodeJS (at least 10.18.1) to be installed with `npm` being available in PATH.
If no NodeJS is already installed on your system, Surreal Docs installer will
install an appropriate version (18.16.0) automatically.

Note also that in order to work Surreal Docs requires Microsoft Visual Studio to
be installed on your machine.

You can find more info about the installation process on the ["Installation"](https://docs.medelfor.com/medelfor/surreal-docs/latest/en-US/docs/installation "Installation process description") page of [Surreal Docs documentation](https://docs.medelfor.com/medelfor/surreal-docs "Surreal Docs documentation").

## Quickstart

Surreal Docs installer installs the Surreal Docs CLI, so you would be able
to run Surreal Docs from the command line.

In order to generate documentation for your Unreal Engine project, please open
a console of your choice (Windows CMD, PowerShell, etc.) and navigate to the 
root directory[1] of your Unreal Engine project.

When done, please run the following command in your console:
```
surdocs init
```

It will invoke the initialization screen where you can set options of your project
and the documentation you are going to generate. Surreal Docs will detect and set most
settings automatically, but you should review them and update if 
necessary.

On the same screen you should choose the project modules for which you want to generate documentation.

After everything's finished, please click the "Done" button and wait until
Surreal Docs will set up your project.

Note that Surreal Docs changes the `.uproject` file, so before changing it,
the system makes a backup of the file and saves it in the same directory.

The `surdocs init` must be run only once, on the initial setup of the project.

If `surdocs init` has finished successfully, then please run the next command:

```
surdocs generate <output directory>
```

It will invoke the generation screen and start generating your documentation.
You will be able to observe the progress and will see error's details if
something goes wrong.

Note that the first time you run `surdocs generate` the generation will take some
extra time, since Surreal Docs needs to compile the plugin it installs in order
to link with Unreal Engine.

You can find more info that will help you get up to speed on the ["Quickstart"](https://docs.medelfor.com/medelfor/surreal-docs/latest/en-US/docs/quickstart "Quickstart") page.

## Telemetry

By default, Surreal Docs collects and sends us anonymized usage data, such as
ID of your machine, version of Surreal Docs you're running, etc. In order to
disable it, please provide `--no-tele` argument when starting Surreal Docs CLI.
It will disable the telemetry for the time current command is running. Example:

```
surdocs --no-tele generate out
```

Note however that by letting Surreal Docs collect anonymized usage data
you help the development process a lot. 

The collection of this data is governed by Surreal Docs EULA that can be found
in the `LICENSE` file.

You can find more info about global options available in Surreal Docs CLI on the ["Global options"](https://docs.medelfor.com/medelfor/surreal-docs/latest/en-US/docs/cli/global-options "Global options") page.

## Privacy

Your privacy is important to us! While you can read more about your privacy when
using Surreal Docs in the EULA, you can be sure that we **do not**, under any
