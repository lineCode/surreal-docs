The Licensed Technology


1. What Technology Medelfor Is Licensing to You
The Licensed Technology licensed to you under this Agreement includes all Surreal Docs code and related content that is copied to your computer when you install Surreal Docs. This includes Surreal Docs Core Source Code, Examples and any Documentation related to Surreal Docs.


“Surreal Docs Core Source Code” means the Source Code (as defined below) and object code of Surreal Docs Core (a.k.a. “udocs-processor”) and the plugin integrating Surreal Docs and Unreal Engine[1] Source Code (a.k.a “unrealistic-docs-ue”), including any future versions made available to you by us under this Agreement and any object code compiled from that Source Code.


“Source Code” means the human readable form of a software program, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation, and installation of an executable.


“Examples” means the code, artwork, or other content made available by us in the samples folder in the install directory.


“Documentation” means the code, artwork, or other content made available by us in the docs folder in the install directory.


The Licensed Technology includes any modified version of any of the foregoing that you make under the License.


2. How You Can Use the Licensed Technology
Medelfor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to privately use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Licensed Technology in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the “License”). This means that as long as you are not violating this Agreement or applicable law, you can privately use the Licensed Technology however you want. If you want to share the Licensed Technology or anything you make with it, Sections 3 and 4 below address when and how you can do that.


3. How You Can Share Products You’ve Made with the Licensed Technology
If you develop products, services, or any other projects that (i) are made using any Licensed Technology or (ii) combine any Licensed Technology with any other software or content (collectively “Products”), you may only Distribute those Products as expressly permitted in this Section 3. Any Product that you Distribute that incorporates Licensed Technology must incorporate the Licensed Technology only in object code. You are not allowed to sell, resell, rent, lease or in any other way make profit from products combined with the Licensed Technology. You are required to open the source code of the Product. Any Product that you Distribute that incorporates Licensed Technology must be distributed under the terms of this Agreement. You are required to attribute to Medelfor, by providing the following visible line in the credits of the Product or elsewhere applicable:
“This product uses Surreal Docs - a development of Medelfor. Surreal Docs © 2022-2023 - Medelfor, Limited. All rights reserved.”


This Agreement does not govern in any way the product or source code for which the documentation is generated, with the only exception when the product is bundled with the Licensed Technology. In other words the source code (or Input as described below) is outside of scope of this Agreement.


“Distribute” means, with respect to a Product, to provide or otherwise make a copy of the Product available publicly or to any other person or entity or make the Product’s functionality available on a network.


Documentation generated by the Licensed Technology (“Generated Documentation”) is not considered a product made with the Licensed Technology and hereby may be freely sold, resold, rented, leased or distributed in any other way, paid or unpaid, by you to any third party. All copyright rights regarding Content of the Generated Documentation belong to you or its respective owners.


You are not allowed to build any documentation storages analogous to e.g. Surreal Cloud that are intended specifically to store documentation produced by Surreal Docs in any format developed specifically for Surreal Docs, e.g. in format of internal JSON definitions that Surreal Docs uses. However you may freely store HTML pages and images produced by Surreal Docs anywhere you please.


“Content of the Generated Documentation” means any text or images or code in the “Generated Documentation” that was produced by the Licensed Technology from your Input, with exception of HTML/CSS/JS code that was a part of Licensed Technology already, e.g. the documentation themes or templates.


“Input” means source code and/or Unreal Engine project that was specified by you for the Licensed Technology to produce the Generated Documentation from.


4. How You Can Share the Licensed Technology When It Isn’t Part of a Product
You may only Distribute Licensed Technology (including as modified by you) outside of a Product as expressly permitted by this Section 4.


5. Other Restrictions on Your Use of the Licensed Technology
a. Non-Compatible Licenses
You may not, and may not permit others to, combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement (those licenses, the “Non-Compatible Licenses”). This means, for example, that you may not combine the Licensed Technology with code or content that is licensed under any of the following licenses: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.


b. General Restrictions

This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights. If any rights to be licensed under this Section 6(c) may not be licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert any of those rights.

Payments and refunds


17. Price
The price we charge to license the Licensed Technology to you (the Price), is as stated on our Store’s original website available by the address store.medelfor.com (the Store) on the moment of you accepting the terms of this Agreement.


Note that the Price shown in the Store can be different depending on the location of the website viewer. Given this it is prohibited to use Virtual Private Networks or any other kind of impersonalization software or hardware to make the Store display the prices for a region different from the one you or the legal entity you represent are located in.


The Price from the website must be selected with regard whether you are a legal entity or an individual and whether you need to lift the restrictions described in the sections 20.a or 20.b


The Price is active until the end of current licensing period (as defined below). With the next licensing period the Price may change.


18. Trial period and licensing period
If you have never acquired access to the Licensed Technology under terms of this Agreement then you are eligible for the Trial Period of <> days. The Trial Period starts immediately after you activate it in the Store. You are required to connect a payment method (the Payment Method) in order for the Trial Period to start. During the Trial Period no money will be debited using the connected payment method. You can cancel the Trial Period anytime. In such case you still will be granted access to the Licensed Technology under terms of this Agreement until the end of the trial period.


In case the trial period was not canceled, after the end of it the Price will be debited from the Payment Method. In case of the successful charge your access to the Licensed Technology under terms of this Agreement will be prolonged by one Licensing Period (as defined below).


“Licensing Period” means the atomic period you can be granted access to the Licensed Technology under terms of this Agreement. Available Licensing Periods under terms of this Agreement are one month (the Monthly Licensing Period) and one year (the Annual Licensing Period).


Licensing Period starts at the next day after the last day of trial period or at the next day after the last day of the previous Licensing Period or at the day you acquire access to the Licensed Technology under terms of this Agreement via the Store. In any of these cases the Licensing Period will start only if the according payment was received by us (except for the case when the Price is free).


The duration of Licensing Period is calculated as follows
* The duration of Monthly Licensing Period is equal to the duration of the month the Licensing Period started in;
* The duration of Annual Licensing Period is equal to 365 (three hundred sixty five) days. Additional day is added to the Annual Licensing Period in the following cases:
   * The month Licensing Period started in is not February or January and the next year after the year it started in is the leap year;
   * The month Licensing Period started in February or January and the year it started in is the leap year.


If during the checkout process you selected the “Automatically renew my subscription” checkbox, then on the first day after the first or another Licensing Period ends, the Price will be debited using the Payment Method and, if successful, the second Licensing Period will start automatically.


Please note that if "Automatically renew my subscription" is not selected, then the first payment after the Trial Period ends will happen anyway (in case the Trial Period wasn't canceled).


Note that durations of the Trial Period and the Licensing Period do not regard the exact time of the day one of the periods was started. For instance if the Trial Period was activated at 11:59 AM, then in one minute the first day of the Trial Period will be counted as passed.


The Licensing Period can be canceled anytime with no fees. In such case your access to the Licensed Technology will still be valid through the initially planned end date for this Licensing Period.


In case the Licensing Period has ended but no required payment was received to start the new period, your access will be suspended but you will be given several extra days to make the payment and reactivate the access. In case such payment will not be received we will have to terminate the access.
